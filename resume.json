		"summary": "This paper presents literature review of intelligent evacuation management systems in high-rise buildings all over the world so as to validate it to improve the evacuation systems in existing high-rise buildings in India. It studies means of egress, evacuation strategies & models along with crowd monitoring and prediction strategies employed in high-rise buildings. Based on this review, the author presents a decision model using information available in the form building and egress specifications as well as information variables like occupant density (RFID technology), spread and location of fire (Smoke Sensor Technology), etc. to guide the rescue team for fast and safe evacuation of building occupants"
